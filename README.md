# HackBio mini-projects repository

This repository contains two projects completed as part of two different HackBio courses. Each project focuses on different aspects of bioinformatics and computational biology, demonstrating key skills in data analysis, programming, and biological data interepretation.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two directories, each corresponding to a specific HackBio course:
```
HackBio_mini_projects/
│-- project_1/  # Extreme Plotting in R
│-- project_2/  # Biomarker Discovery for Early Cancer Detection
│-- README.md
```

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: [Extreme Plotting in R](https://github.com/manal-agdada/HackBio_mini_projects/tree/main/project_1)

**Course:** [Data Science with R for Life Scientists: Beginners](https://thehackbio.com/courses/2) 

**Description:** Use base R to generate plots from randomly generated data.

### Project 2: [Biomarker Discovery for Early Cancer Detection](https://github.com/manal-agdada/HackBio_mini_projects/tree/main/project_2)

**Course:** [Advanced Genomics Course: Bioinformatics for Cancer Biology](https://thehackbio.com/courses/59)

**Description:** Identify potential biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer by analyzing TCGA differential gene expression data. This project focuses on finding genes that are significantly expressed in early-stage pancreatic cancers compared to normal tissues.
