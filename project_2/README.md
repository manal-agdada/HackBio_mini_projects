# Biomarker Discovery for Early Cancer Detection

## Overview 
This project aims at identifying potential biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer (Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: PAAD) by analyzing differential gene expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The focus is on finding genes that are significantly expressed in early-stage pancreatic cancer compared to normal tissues.

## Steps
1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Download RNA-seq data for early-stage pancreatic cancer patients and normal controls from TCGA (10 samples each).
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Perform normalization and filtering to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Differential Expression Analysis**
   - Identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed between early-stage pancreatic cancer samples and normal samples.
4. **Clinical Relevance**
   - Assess the potential of identified biomarkers for clinical applications, such as early detection and targeted therapy.
